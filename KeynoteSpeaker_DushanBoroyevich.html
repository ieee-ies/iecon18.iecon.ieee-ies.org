  							Title: Future Electronic Energy Systems
  						</h4>
  						<p style="text-align: justify">
  							<strong>Abstract: </strong>Anticipated widespread usage of new power electronics technologies in electrical energy generation, transport, and consumption is expected to provide major efficiency improvements, while the deployment of smart grid technologies should improve the utilization and availability of electricity. Consequently, after a decade of premonition, it is now becoming increasingly clear that the future human energy needs will be dominantly provided by electricity, which will be delivered through scalable, hierarchical, electronic energy systems: the Intergrid. Safe, dependable, sustainable, enjoyable and beautiful supply of free energy, anytime, anywhere, for everyone.
The proposed nanogrid-microgrid–…–grid structure achieves hierarchical dynamic decoupling of generation, distribution, and consumption by using bidirectional electronic power converters as electronic energy routers. Similar trend is already happening in modern electronic power distribution systems built for airplanes, ships, road and off-road vehicles, data-centers, industrial processes, and buildings. These systems often comprise hundreds of electronic power converters, introducing a distinction that is utterly challenging our basic understanding about how power systems are designed and operated. The challenge seems even more daunting when thinking about how the electrical grid will be impacted by the massive onslaught of renewable and distributed generation, and it is therefore essential to develop innovative methods that allow easier system-level modeling, improved system integration, and continuous assessment of dynamic interactions.
Starting from the current and expected trends in the generation, transport, and consumption of electrical energy, this talk will contemplate possible future ac and dc electronic energy system architectures, especially in the presence of renewable energy sources. Several possible directions for modeling, analysis, and system-level design of such systems, including power flow control, protection, stability, and subsystem interactions, will be briefly discussed.

  							Brief Biography
  						</h4>
  						<p style="text-align: justify">
  							Dushan Boroyevich received his Dipl. Ing. degree from the University of Belgrade in 1976 and his M.S. degree from the University of Novi Sad in 1982, in what then used to be Yugoslavia.  He received his Ph.D. degree in 1986 from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech), Blacksburg, USA. From 1986 to 1990, he was an assistant professor and director of the Power and Industrial Electronics Research Program in the Institute for Power and Electronic Engineering at the University of Novi Sad. He then joined the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech as associate professor. He is now University Distinguished Professor and Associate Vice President for Research and Innovation in Energy Systems at Virginia Tech, and Director of the Center for Power Electronics Systems.
Dr. Boroyevich has led numerous research projects in the areas of multi-phase power conversion, electronic power distribution systems, modeling and control, and multi-disciplinary design optimization. He has advised over 40 Ph.D. and 40 M.S. students to graduation and has co-authored with them over 700 papers.
Dushan was the president of the IEEE Power Electronics Society (PELS) for 2011-12. He is a Fellow of IEEE and recipient of numerous awards, including the IEEE William E. Newell Power Electronics Technical Field Award, the IEEE PELS Harry A. Owen Distinguished Service Award, European Power Electronics Association (EPE) Outstanding Achievement Award, and the Award for Outstanding Achievements and Service to Profession by the European Power Electronics and Motion Control Council. He is an Honorary Professor at the Xi’an Jiaotong University in Xi’an, China, and received the K.T. Li Chair Professor Award at the National Cheng Kung University, in Tainan, Taiwan. Dushan was elected to the US National Academy of Engineering in 2014 for advancements in control, modeling, and design of electronic power conversion for electric energy and transportation.
